  "description": "Yotsuba&! is centered on Yotsuba Koiwai, a five-year-old[18] girl who is energetic, cheerful, curious, odd, and quirky—so much so that even her own father calls her unusual. She is also initially ignorant about many things that a child her age would be expected to know—among them doorbells, escalators, air conditioners, and even playground swings.[19] This naïveté is the premise of humorous stories whereby which she learns about—and frequently misunderstands—everyday things.[20]",
